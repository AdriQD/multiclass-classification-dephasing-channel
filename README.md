here available the codes used in the homonymous article, link at: https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.01571

In this repository both the code for data generation part and the several neural networks model applied for numerical studies are available.
Necessary dependance for virtual environment are:
qutip, keras, msmath. 

The data generation code run made use of the python multiprocess library for parallel computation.
